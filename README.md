## 🌟 Introduction

**God's Hand** is a revolutionary decentralized disaster relief platform that bridges the gap between urgent humanitarian needs and global generosity through cutting-edge AI technology and blockchain infrastructure. 

In a world where natural disasters strike without warning, traditional relief systems often fail due to..
- bureaucratic delays
- lack of transparency
- inefficient fund allocation.

God's Hand transforms this paradigm by deploying **autonomous AI agents** that continuously monitor global events, instantly assess disaster situations, and facilitate **rapid, transparent, and democratically-governed relief funding**.

Powered by **MOSAIA AI agents** running on **Phala's Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)** and secured by **Flow blockchain's smart contract infrastructure**, our platform ensures complete transparency, trustless operations, and community-driven decision making. Every donation, every claim, and every allocation is immutably recorded on the **Flow  blockchain**, governed by the collective wisdom of verified global citizens, creating a truly decentralized ecosystem that eliminates the systemic failures plaguing traditional relief systems.

**Revolutionary Donor Incentives**: God's Hand introduces the world's first **disaster relief raffle system** powered by **Flow's Verifiable Random Function (VRF)**. Every donation, regardless of amount, automatically enters donors into a transparent, tamper-proof raffle to win 5% of the total funds raised for each disaster event, creating unprecedented donor engagement and participation incentives.

## 🚨 The Problems in Current Systems

Traditional funding platforms face systemic issues that undermine their effectiveness for disaster relief:

**1. Fraud & Scam Proliferation**
- Rise of **fake campaigns** using synthetic identities and deepfake technology
- **Fraud-as-a-Service platforms** making scam creation accessible to non-technical criminals
- **$23 billion projected synthetic identity fraud losses** by 2030 (Deloitte, 2024)

**2. Quality Control Issues**
- **Minimal vetting processes** for project feasibility

**3. Governance & Transparency Gaps**
- **No community involvement** in project direction after funding.
- **Opaque fund allocation** with no real-time tracking.
- **Marketing bias** favoring campaigns with better promotion over genuine need.

**4. Lack of Donor Incentives**
- **Zero rewards or recognition** for donors beyond moral satisfaction
- **No engagement mechanisms** to encourage repeat donations or larger contributions
- **Absence of gamification** that could significantly increase participation rates
- **No transparent reward systems** that could build donor loyalty and trust

## 🔬 Why God's Hand (AI agents + Blockchain) is the Solution?

### 🛠️ **Mosaia Tools Integration**

#### **1. BBOX Identifier Tool** `(mosaia ID: 6864d67fca5744854d34c8c6)`
**Purpose**: Translates a human-readable location (e.g., "Mumbai, India") into geographic coordinates and a bounding box, which defines the region's spatial extent.

**How it works**:
1. You send a location in human-readable format
2. The tool makes a request to the Geoapify API
3. The Boundary Box values of that specific location is returned, like this:
   
   ```
   min_latitude: minLat,
   max_latitude: maxLat,
   min_longitude: minLon,
   max_longitude: maxLon
   ```

**Required Environment Variables**:
- `Geoapify API Key`

**📁 Line of Code**: [BBOX Tool](https://github.com/SamFelix03/Gods-Hand/tree/main/Mosaia%20tools/bboxtool)

#### **2. WeatherXM Tool** `(mosaia ID: 6864dcc425ddf4f7d390d91b)`
**Purpose**: Integrates WeatherXM to provide real-time, hyperlocal weather data for disaster assessment and relief planning. The data collected from WeatherXM's decentralized network of weather stations is sent to the agent.

**How it works**:
1. Enter the bbox values of a specific location
2. Using the bounding box, the system queries the WeatherXM endpoint which returns a list of all weather stations located within the defined geographical bounds
3. The response is filtered to include only active stations, i.e., those that have reported recent weather data
4. Up to 5 randomly selected active stations are queried for their latest observations
5. Each response includes:
   - **Observation data**: temperature, precipitation, wind speed/gust, humidity, UV index, solar irradiance, etc.
   - **Location metadata**: latitude, longitude, elevation
   - **Health scores**: data quality, location accuracy
6. These details provide granular, real-time insights into the current weather conditions around a specific location

**Required Environment Variables**:
- `WeatherXM API key`

**📁 Line of Code**: [WeatherXM Tool](https://github.com/SamFelix03/Gods-Hand/tree/main/Mosaia%20tools/Mosaia-Weather-XM-Tool)

#### **3. Mosaia Twitter Poster Tool** `(mosaia ID: 6864e68268d0c18b74da20e7)`
**Purpose**: A Mosaia Tool that helps your agent post tweets using the Twitter API.

**What It Does**: This tool allows your Mosaia agent to post tweets by sending a message to the Twitter API using your account credentials.

**Required Environment Variables**:
- `TWITTER_API_KEY`
- `TWITTER_API_SECRET`
- `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET`

## ⛓️ **Flow Integration**

### 📋 **Deployed Contract**
**🔗 Contract Address**: [Flow Testnet Explorer](https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/address/0x700D3D55ec6FC21394A43b02496F320E02873114?tab=index)

### 🏗️ **Smart Contract Architecture**

#### **Key Components**

##### **1. Disaster Management**
- **Disaster Creation**: Agent creates a disaster relief campaign with title, metadata, and target amount
- **Unique Identification**: Each disaster gets a unique hash based on creator, timestamp, and metadata
- **Status Control**: Disasters can be activated/deactivated by the Agent

##### **2. Donation System**
- **Direct Donations**: Users can donate Flow directly to specific disasters
- **Contribution Tracking**: Individual donor contributions are tracked per disaster
- **Funding Progress**: Real-time calculation of funding progress as percentage of target

##### **3. Fund Management**
- **Secure Storage**: All donations are held securely in the smart contract
- **Controlled Release**: Only the Agent running inside the TEE can unlock funds
  
## 🎰 **Gamification Through VRF Raffle**

### **The Lottery Experience**

The GodsHand platform introduces an innovative gamification layer that transforms disaster relief from a purely altruistic act into an engaging experience:

#### **🎯 How It Works**
1. **Donation Entry**: Every donation automatically enters the donor into the lottery
2. **Unique Participation**: Each unique donor address gets one entry (regardless of donation amount)
3. **Fair Selection**: VRF ensures truly random winner selection
4. **Prize Distribution**: Winner receives 5% of the total disaster fund
5. **Transparency**: All lottery results are publicly verifiable

#### **🔐 VRF Integration Benefits**
- **Verifiable Randomness**: Cadence Arch provides cryptographically secure random numbers
- **Fairness**: No manipulation possible by contract owner or disaster creator
- **Transparency**: Random number generation is publicly verifiable
- **Decentralization**: Relies on external VRF service, not contract-controlled randomness

#### **🧠 Psychological Impact**
- **Increased Engagement**: Donors are motivated by the chance to win
- **Repeated Participation**: Gamification encourages continued donations
- **Community Building**: Creates excitement and discussion around disaster relief
- **Viral Potential**: Lottery winners may share their experience, attracting more donors

**📁 Line of Code**: [Flow Contract](https://github.com/SamFelix03/Gods-Hand/tree/main/Flow%20contract)

### 🌦WeatherXM integration

WeatherXM powers the agent with real-time, hyperlocal weather data from WeatherXM’s decentralized network of weather stations — serving as the primary and trusted data source for disaster detection, severity analysis, and fund allocation

#### Workflow Overview:
- The agent begins by receiving a bounding box (bbox) defining the geographical area of concern.
- It queries WeatherXM’s API to locate all weather stations within this region.
- Only active stations—those providing recent and verifiable data—are considered.
- Up to five active stations are randomly sampled in the specified location.

Each station provides:
**Detailed weather observations**
- Temperature
- Feels Like
- Dew Point
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Wind Gust
- Wind Direction
- Pressure
- UV Index

The agent heavily relies on this granular, real-time data to:

- Evaluate the intensity and scope of the disaster, such as identifying flooding risks, wind damage potential, or heatwaves.
- Determine the urgency and severity of the situation in specific micro-locations.
- Autonomously calculate and allocate appropriate relief funding, ensuring aid reaches those most impacted.
